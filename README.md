The Financial Fraud Detection Model utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Data 
Analytics to identify suspicious transactions, detect fraudulent activities, and provide real
time insights via an interactive dashboard. This system is essential for banks, fintech 
companies, and financial institutions to mitigate risks and prevent financial fraud.

Key Features:-
1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing 
2. Fraud Detection Algorithms
3.Interactive Dashboard & Reporting

Technology Stack:-
1. Data Processing & ML Models
2. Backend & Dashboard

Challenges & Solutions:-  
1. Imbalanced dataset (low fraud cases)       Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling) & anomaly detection.
2. High false positives                       Optimize thresholds & ensemble learning models.
3. Evolving fraud patterns                    Adaptive learning with auto-updating ML models.
